-- We have a student table that also stores the Course_id of a student's favorite course. Our task has two parts related to using a SELF JOIN:

SELECT
    s1.St_id,
    s1.St_Name,
    s1.Department,
    s2.St_id,
    s2.St_Name,
    s2.Department
FROM Student AS s1
INNER JOIN Student AS s2
ON s1.Department = s2.Department
AND s1.St_id <> s2.St_id;

--     Find pairs of students that belong to the same department.
--     Identify students who have chosen the same Course_id as their favorite. Display the St_id, St_Name, and Course_id and order it in increasing Course_id.

SELECT DISTINCT
    s1.St_id,
    s1.St_Name,
    s1.Course_id
FROM Student AS s1
INNER JOIN Student AS s2
ON s1.Course_id = s2.Course_id
AND s1.St_id <> s2.St_id
ORDER BY s1.Course_id;
